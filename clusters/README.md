> This is where the cluster definition packages are stored, you can find examples in the __eg__ folder.  Create a parent org folder for yourself (Eg. me) and then simply copy one of the examples into your folder and edit as required.

All items in this folder will be ignored by cluster-builder.

> You can initialize this folder as one or more submodule repos dedicated to storing your cluster configurations, or manage the cluster definitions by another means.  The contents of this folder will not be committed to the cluster-builder git repo.
